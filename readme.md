# UARK Bus Map Project

## Introduction

### Project address: [uarkbus.info](http://uarkbus.info)

The UARK-Bus-Map-Project is aimed to improve usability of the official [campusmap.uark.edu](http://campusmap.uark.edu) web app.

The are server issues with the offical app:

1. Large file size, take some time to load in a mobile environment.
2. Long javascript file, with almost 4000 lines, making the script hard to run on slow mobile processor.
3. Interface not mobile friendly and intuitive.

This project improved:

1. Simplified file and structure, make it faster to load and execute.
2. Improved user interface.
3. Removed functions that are not related to query bus route information.
